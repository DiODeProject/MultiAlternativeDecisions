# Code to generate Figure 6

## Plotting the violation of the regularity principle

To plot the violation of the regularity principle (Figure 6a), call
```
violationOfRegularity
```
at the MATLAB command line. To plot the violation of the  regularity principle for 4 options (not a part of the paper), call
```
violationOfRegularity_3to4
```
at the MATLAB command line.


## Plotting the similarity effect and its evolution with time

To plot the similarity effect (Figure 6b), call 
```
similarityEffect
```
at the MATLAB command line. To plot the evolution of the similarity effect with time (Figure 6c in our paper), originally shown in Figure 4 of Trueblood et al. *Psych. Rev.* 2014), call
```
similarityEffectwTime
``` 
at the MATLAB command line.
