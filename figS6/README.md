# Code to generate Figure S6.

## Generation of performance data

Performance data for different model parameter combinations are generated by calling
```
exploreParamChanges()
```
Please beware that this script requires the folder `exploreParamChanges` to exist, and will take a very long time to run.

The script furthermore expects a compiled version of `simulateDiffusionRTC` in the same folder. Please see the instructions in the `mexFiles` folder on how to compile `simulateDiffusionRTC`.

## Plotting performance data

After the performance data has been generated, the results can be plotted by running
```
plotExploreParamChanges()
```
at the MATLAB comment line.

## TODO

The parameter ranges don't match those in the SI. Check if Laplace has those parameter ranges set correctly, and update the code accordingly.
