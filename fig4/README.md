# Code to generate Figure 4

## Plotting buildup and offset of the urgency signal

Figures 4a-b of the paper correspond to the buildup and offset (initial point, u_0) of the urgency signal. To plot these, use
```
urgency_buildup_offset
```
at the MATLAB command line. Note that the data parts of Figures 4a-b (top) have been taken from Supplementary Figure 6b of Churchland et al., Decision-making with multiple alternatives, *Nat. Neurosci.* (2008)

## Plotting Hick's law

Figure 4c corresponds to Hick's law. To plot this for value-based and perceptual decisions, use
```
reactionTime
```
at the MATLAB command line.
